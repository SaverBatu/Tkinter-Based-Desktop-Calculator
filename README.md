Tkinter-Based Desktop Calculator

This project is a desktop calculator application developed using the Python programming language and the Tkinter library. It was created as part of my computer engineering studies to integrate basic algorithms with Graphical User Interface (GUI) components.
Technical Features

    Interface: Designed with Tkinter, Python's standard GUI library.

    Operations: Includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions.

    Error Handling: To prevent the program from crashing during runtime, controls for cases such as invalid data entry (ValueError) and division by zero have been implemented using try-except blocks.

    Modular Structure: Mathematical operations and interface triggers are structured as independent functions.

Installation and Usage

Python 3.x must be installed on your computer for the project to run. It does not require any external library installation.

    Clone the repository or download the files.

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Start the application with the following command:
    Bash

    python calculator.py

Purpose of the Project

This study was developed to understand the communication between backend (calculation logic) and frontend (interface management) layers and to gain practice in writing robust code against user errors.
